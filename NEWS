News about the R package VSURF:
--------------------------------


Main changes in Version 0.8 (2013-11-23):
* Parallel version of VSURF added. Three new main functions:
VSURF.parallel, VSURF.thres.parallel and VSURF.interp.parallel.
Default for these functions is to run VSURF in parallel on a
(local) SOCKET cluster with "number of cores detected by R" minus
one core
* Addition of a print function for VSURF results
* Bug fix: the fact that the prediction step can not run
does not give an error anymore


Main changes in Version 0.7.6 (2013-11-13):
* Plot functions changed. It is now possible to plot VI mean
and VI standard deviation against variables names with function
plot.VSURF.thres. By default index variables are plotted, and
var.names argument is added to all plot functions
* Bug concerning ylab and yticks fixed
* Addition of a warning when using formula method of VSURF,
VSURF.thres, VSURF.interp and VSURF.pred: indices of selected
variables must be reordered to get indices of the original
dataset


Main changes in Version 0.7.5 (2013-10-04):
* Only plot functions changed. It is now possible to choose the number
of variables for the VI mean and the VI standard deviation plots.
It is also possible to choose if VI mean and/or VI standard
deviation plots must be plooted by function plot.VSURF.thres


Main changes in Version 0.7 (2013-09-10):
* The package can be used with the formula-type call. Hence the package can handle
missing values (NA) (only when used with the formula-type call, as randomForest does)
* Update of the plot.VSURF function: the two last graphs show the variables names on the
x-axis
* New functions (intermediate plots): plot.VSURF.thres, plot.VSURF.interp, plot.VSURF.pred
* Functions renamed: VSURF.interp.tune -> tune.VSURF.interp, VSURF.thres.tune -> tune.thres.tune
and S3method are now used for these functions


Main changes in Version 0.6 (2013-07-23):
* New functions: plot.VSURF, summary.VSURF, VSURF.interp.tune, VSURF.thres.tune.
* Addition of a dataset: toys
* Addition of new outputs of existing functions.
* Bug fix: min.thres component of VSURF results list returns now the threshold value.
